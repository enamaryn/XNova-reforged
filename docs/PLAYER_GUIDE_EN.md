# Player Guide - XNova Reforged

## Welcome

XNova Reforged is a space strategy game where you build an interstellar empire.
Grow your economy, unlock technology, and command fleets across the galaxy.

## Game goals

1. Grow your economy (mines and storage).
2. Research technologies to unlock new options.
3. Build fleets to explore, attack, and colonize.
4. Join alliances and cooperate.
5. Reach the top of the rankings.

## Resources

### Resource types

- **Metal**
  - Use: buildings, ships, defenses.
  - Production: Metal Mine.
  - Storage: Metal Storage.

- **Crystal**
  - Use: advanced tech and ships.
  - Production: Crystal Mine.
  - Storage: Crystal Storage.

- **Deuterium**
  - Use: fleet fuel and advanced tech.
  - Production: Deuterium Synthesizer.
  - Storage: Deuterium Tank.

- **Energy**
  - Production: Solar Plant, Fusion Reactor, Satellites.
  - Use: powers mines.

- **Dark matter**
  - Use: premium advantages (not in MVP).

### Energy management

If energy is negative, production goes down.

Example:
- Energy production: 500
- Energy consumption: 700
- Balance: -200
- Effective production: 500 / 700 = 71%

Fix: increase energy production (solar plant or fusion reactor).

## Buildings

### Resource buildings

- **Metal Mine** (early priority)
- **Crystal Mine**
- **Deuterium Synthesizer**
- **Solar Plant**
- **Fusion Reactor** (advanced energy)

### Storage buildings

- **Metal / Crystal Storage**
- **Deuterium Tank**

### Development buildings

- **Robotics Factory**: reduces build time.
- **Shipyard**: unlocks ships.
- **Research Lab**: unlocks research.
- **Nanite Factory**: massive time reduction (late game).

## Technologies

### Essential tech

- **Energy**: boosts reactors, required for many techs.
- **Computer**: increases fleet slots.
- **Espionage**: better spy reports.
- **Combustion / Impulse / Hyperspace**: ship speed.

### Combat tech

- **Weapons**: attack bonus.
- **Shield**: shield bonus.
- **Armor**: hull bonus.

## Ships

### Transport

- **Small Cargo**: fast, low capacity.
- **Large Cargo**: slower, big capacity.
- **Recycler**: collects debris.

### Combat

- **Light Fighter**: early game core.
- **Heavy Fighter**: mid game.
- **Cruiser**: strong vs fighters.
- **Battleship**: raw power.
- **Bomber**: anti defense.

### Special

- **Espionage Probe**: spying.
- **Colony Ship**: creates new colonies.
- **Solar Satellite**: cheap energy, fragile.

## Combat

- 6 rounds max.
- Rapid fire: some ships shoot multiple times.
- Explosion: 70% chance if hull < 30%.
- Debris: 30% of costs becomes debris.

Simplified formula:
```
Damage = Weapon Power * (1 - Shield / 100)
```

Loot:
- Up to 50% of enemy resources.
- Limited by cargo capacity.

Tips:
- Spy before attacking.
- Check cargo capacity.
- Favor ships with rapid fire.

## Galaxy

- 5 galaxies x 499 systems x 15 positions.
- Coordinates: [G:S:P]

Position types:
- Occupied planet: interaction possible.
- Inactive planet: easy target.
- Empty slot: can be colonized.

Colonization:
1. Build a colony ship.
2. Have Astrophysics tech.
3. Launch a colonize mission on an empty slot.

## Alliances

- Create or join by invitation.
- Tag 3-8 characters.
- Benefits: coordination, protection, ranking.

## Statistics

Point types:
- Economy
- Research
- Military
- Military destroyed
- Military lost

Rankings update regularly.

## Strategies

### Early game (Day 1-3)
- Level up metal and crystal mines.
- Keep solar plant stable.
- Start early research.

### Mid game (Week 1-2)
- Mines level 15-20.
- Improve propulsion.
- Build a balanced fleet.

### Late game (Week 3+)
- Tech level 20+.
- Heavy fleets and wars.
- Optimized colonies.

## Pro tips

1. Size storage for offline time.
2. Fleet save before logging out.
3. Spy with a single probe.
4. Recycle debris.
5. Start long research before disconnect.
